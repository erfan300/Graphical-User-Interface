# Graphical-User-Interface

In this mini-project, I've utilised JavaFX and Java to create a graphical user interface that holds a list of musicians, the title of their song and a comment. 

The user is also allowed to add their own musician via the add functionalilty/button which then takes the user to another scene that allows them to input the details that was once state before.

The user is also able to remove anyone from the list via the remove funtionality/button which then takes the user to another scene which asks the user whether they are sure about their choice via a confirm or cancel button.

There is also a shuffle and quit functionality that works likewise to the other ones.
